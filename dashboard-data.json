Based on your brain dump, here are my suggestions:\n\n**New Tasks to Add:**\n\n**Personal Category:**\n1. **\"Sell boat\"** - Priority: Month\n   - This is a significant task that requires planning\n   - Suggested subtasks: Take photos, research market price, list on platforms, schedule viewings\n\n2. **\"Sell pickup truck\"** - Priority: Month\n   - Similar process to the boat\n   - Suggested subtasks: Clean/detail vehicle, gather paperwork, get valuation, create listing\n\n3. **\"Sell 2nd fridge\"** - Priority: Week\n   - Quicker to sell than vehicles\n   - Suggested subtasks: Clean fridge, take photos, post on marketplace\n\n4. **\"Apply for visa\"** - Priority: Week (or Today if urgent!)\n   - Time-sensitive and important\n   - Suggested subtasks: Check requirements, gather documents, fill application, submit & pay fees\n\n**Quick Actions:**\n- Start with the visa application if it's time-sensitive\n- Bundle the selling tasks - you can use similar platforms and processes\n- Take photos of all items on the same day for efficiency\n\n**Note:** I see you have some test tasks (d, dd, ddd, cc, ccd) in your dashboard. Consider cleaning those up to keep your focus on real priorities.\n\nWould you like me to help break down any of these tasks further or suggest the best order to tackle them?",
